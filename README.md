# vision_ai_detection_model
This project compares ANN, Basic CNN, and Deeper CNN on CIFAR-100 for image classification. It covers data preprocessing, model training with callbacks, evaluation using metrics and confusion matrices, and prediction analysis. The Deeper CNN achieved the best performance, with additional experiments on class-specific weaknesses.
